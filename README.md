# Clean History demo

To better read the git history of a repository it is sometimes useful to squash commits together. This is especially useful when working on a feature branch that has a lot of commits. This demo showcases how to squash commits together. To read more about squashing commits, see [this](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History) link. We do not recommend squashing commits on the main branch, but instead on feature branches as they are merged into the main branch.
